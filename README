CONTAINS

add_stylus_support.patch
    The Android framework patch (frameworks/base/). This patch is based on
    CyanogenMod Gingerbread commit d48995a48bb5f6ca6fe50b4b9ec8877155637af3

wac_android.c
    Kernel driver (drivers/input/tablet/) that creates a sysfs node to receive
    data from userspace program and create input events for the Android system.

util/
    The userspace utility (a modified 'wacdump' utility which is distributed by
    the Linux Wacom Project) that reads events from the serial node the active
    digitizer is connected to (such as /dev/ttyUSB0) and writes corresponding
    data to the /sys/devices/platform/wac_android/input sysfs node created by
    the wac_android driver. In order to build the utility, the path to the
    Linux kernel being used needs to be specified in the Makefile. A prebuilt
    binary is also provided.

webkit.diff
    This is a simple diff of the changes made in "external/webkit/" (just 2
    lines added) to comply with the notes in the Android system for where
    keycodes must be added.

NOTES

had hoped to clean an organize these changes, but have been unable to thus far.
